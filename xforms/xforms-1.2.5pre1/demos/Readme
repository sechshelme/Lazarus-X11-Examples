This dorectory contains a number of programs demonstrating the
usage and appearance of object classes in the XForms Library.
Note that these programs also serve as testing/QA programs, so
if you have a problem with a particular object, see if the same
object works in the demo program. On the other hand, if one of
the demo programs doesn't work you have rather likely found a
bug in XForms. Please report it!

If this directory was installed from the documentation package
for XForms of a distribution you have to modify and compile the
programs first before you can run them. This requires that the
developm,ent package is also installed.


1) cd into the fd subdirectory and run

     fdesign -convert *.fd


2) In the program you want to compile replace the line with

     #include "include/forms.h"

   by

     #include <forms.h>

3) Compile the program, typically it just needs

     gcc -o xyz xyz.c -lforms

   Some programs also need to be compiled with a C file from
   the fd subdirectory. This is usually simple to figure out:
   if a C file includes a header file from the fd subdirectory
   then you need to compile including the correspoding C file
   from the fd subdirectory.
   
OpenGL/Mesa demos may not work if you configured XForms to be
built without GL support (via the '--disable-gl' option of
'configure').
