			  XForms Version 1.2.0

This is the Free Software distribution of the XForms Library, a
graphical user interface toolkit for X Window Systems.

It should work under X11 R4, R5 & R6. XForms is free software. It is
licensed under the GNU LGPL (Lesser General Public License) version 2.1.
See the file COPYING.LIB for the gory details.


What's new?
-----------

XForms 1.2.0 is a new stable version of the library. Numerous
bugs have been fixed, new features have been added and the
documentation is now part of the package.

For more information, read the file ChangeLog.


Getting XForms
--------------

The XForms homepage is accessible at

  http://xforms-toolkit.org/

The sources can be downloaded from the project page at

  http://www.nongnu.org/xforms/

See the "Download Area" on that page. On this page you should
select the file named 'xforms.latest_stable.tar.gz' (which will
point to the latest stable release, including bug-fixes that may
have become necessary) to download the sources -  unless you're
prepared to take part in testing the "bleeding edge" versions
that have a name containing '-preX' (where X is some number),
indicating that it is a pre-release on the way to a new stable
release.

Compiling XForms
----------------

You should be able to compile XForms on any 'reasonable' flavour of
unix.

XForms relies on some other libraries, namely (for compiling
XForms you will need development versions, i.e. versions that
contain the header files for the libraries)

    * libX11
	* libXpm, version 4.7 or newer.
	* libjpeg, 6.0b or newer.
	* libGL (optional)

You will find generic installation instructions common to all
autoconf-based packages in the file INSTALL. In general, all it
takes to compile and install XForms is

	./configure
	make
	make install

There are some features that you may want to control by using
options when running the 'configure' script'. To find out about
all of them run 'configure' with the '--help' option. The more
commonly used include:

  o --disable-gl makes sure that gl support is not built even if
    you have proper GL libraries installed.

  o --enable-demos adds "demos/" to the list of directories to
    build. It contains various program demonstrating the use of the
    XForms library.

  o --enable-docs instructs the 'configure' script to also
    add the documentation (in info, HTML and PDF format) to
    the targets to be build. This requires some additional
    tools.

For more complicated cases, ./configure takes the following specific
flags:

  o --with-extra-lib=DIRECTORY that specifies the path where XForms will
    find extra libraries (Xpm, jpeg...) it needs. Defaults to NONE
    (i.e. search in standard places). You can specify several
    directories, separated by colons.

  o --with-extra-inc=DIRECTORY that gives the place where XForms will find
    headers.  Defaults to NONE (i.e.  search in standard places).
    You can specify several directories, separated by colons.

  o --with-extra-prefix[=DIRECTORY] that is equivalent to
       --with-extra-lib=DIRECTORY/lib --with-extra-inc=DIRECTORY/include
    If DIRECTORY is not specified, the current prefix is used.

  o --enable-optimization=VALUE enables you to set optimization to a
    higher level as the default (-O), for example --enable-optimization=-O3.

  o --disable-optimization - you can use this to disable compiler
    optimization of LyX. The compile may be much quicker with some
    compilers, but XForms applications will run more slowly.

  o --enable-debug will add debug information to your binary. This
    requires a lot more disk space, but is a must if you want to try to
    debug problems in XForms. The default is to have debug information
    for development versions and prereleases only.

  o --enable-bwc-bs-hack enables some workarounds for incompatibilities
    that may keep very old programs using XForms from working correctly.
    Please only use as a last resort.

Moreover, the following generic configure flags may be useful:

  o --prefix=DIRECTORY specifies the root directory to use for
    installation. [defaults to /usr/local]

  o --enable-maintainer-mode enables some code that automatically
    rebuilds the configure script, makefiles templates and other useful
    files when needed. This is off by default, to avoid surprises.

Note that the --with-extra-* commands are not really robust when it
comes to use of relative paths.  If you really want to use a relative path
here, you can prepend it with "`pwd`/".

If you do not like the default compile flags used (-g -O on gcc), you can
set CFLAGS variable to other values as follows:

  ./configure CFLAGS='-O2' <other-options>

Similarly, if you want to force the use of some specific compiler, you can
give a value to the CC variable.

The following option might be useful in order to make the compiler
more verbose about potential problems:

  o --enable-warnings that make the compiler output more warnings during
    the compilation.  Opposite is --disable-warnings.
