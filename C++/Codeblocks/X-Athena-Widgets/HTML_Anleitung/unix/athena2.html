<h1><font color="#FF0000">1. Xt and the Athena Widgets</font></h1>

<h2><font color="#FF0000">Athena Widgets </font></h2>

<ul>
  <li>this course is based on the Athena widgets </li>
  <li>this is the original widget set, and by current standards is quite primitive </li>
  <li>we are using this widget set for the following reasons: <ol>
      <li>Athena is widely available - it is part of the standard X distribution and should be
        available on any workstation that runs X </li>
      <li>It is fairly simple - this is about the simplest widget set, it is easy to learn </li>
      <li>Athena is efficient - all the widgets are quite simple and require a minimum amount of
        CPU resources </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><font color="#FF0000">Basic Xt Functions </font></h2>

<ul>
  <li>we will start by looking at some of the standard Xt functions that are required by all
    Athena applications </li>
  <li>once we have seen a few of these functions we will look at a simple example </li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">1) XtInitialize </font></h3>

<ul>
  <li>this function is called at the beginning of the program, it initializes the toolkit,
    connects to the X server and does many other things </li>
  <li>there are other ways of initializing X and the toolkit, but this is the easiest way </li>
  <li>the declaration of XtInitialize is: </li>
</ul>

<pre>
    Widget XtInitialize(shell_name, application_class, options,
	 num_options, argc, argv)
    String         shell_name;
    String         application_name;
    XrmOptionDescRec options[];
    int            num_options;
    int            *argc;
    char           *argv[];
</pre>

<ul>
  <li>we won't use the options and num_options parameters, NULL and 0 should be used as their
    values </li>
  <li>the value shell_name is ignored </li>
  <li>application class is the name that is used for the application, we will see how this is
    used later - choose a unique name for this </li>
  <li>the argc and argv parameters come from the corresponding parameters to main, X parses
    the parameters to all X programs looking for standard X parameters </li>
  <li>on return argc contains the number of non-X parameters and argv contain the actual non-X
    parameters </li>
  <li>XtInitialize returns an applicationShell widget, this becomes the root of the widget
    hierarchy of the application that you are writing </li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">2) XtCreateManagedWidget</font></h3>

<ul>
  <li>the XtCreateManagedWidget function is used to create a new widget and have its parent
    manage the newly created widget </li>
  <li>when a widget is managed the parent will assign it screen space within its own space,
    and the widget will be displayed whenever the parent is displayed </li>
  <li>the declaration of XtCreateManagedWidget is:<pre>

    Widget XtCreateManagedWidget(name, widget_class, parent,
	      args, num_args)
    String         name;
    WidgetClass    widget_class
    Widget         parent;
    ArgList        args;
    int            num_args;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>the value returned by XtCreateManagedWidget is the newly created widget </li>
  <li>the name parameter is a character string that will be the name of the newly created
    widget, names should be unique within an application </li>
  <li>widget_class is the type of widget to be created, there are symbolic constants for all
    the widget classes in a toolkit, these names are used for this parameter </li>
  <li>parent is the parent widget of the newly created widget, this widget must have been
    previously created </li>
  <li>args is a list of resource values for the widget, when the widget is created resource
    values can be passed through this parameter, or NULL can be used if no resources are
    passed </li>
  <li>num_args - the number of entries in the args array </li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">3) XtRealizeWidget</font></h3>

<ul>
  <li>when a widget is created at the beginning of a program a window is not automatically
    assigned to it, this is for efficiency </li>
  <li>first all the widgets are created, then the underlying window hierarchy is constructed
    for all the widgets in a single step, this is done by XtRealizeWidget </li>
  <li>this procedure has the following declaration: <pre>
    void XtRealizeWidget(w)
    Widget w;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>the parameter passed to this procedure is a widget, this widget and all of its
    descendants are realized </li>
  <li>usually the parameter passed to XtRealizeWidget is the top level shell created by
    XtInitialize </li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">4) XtMainLoop </font></h3>

<ul>
  <li>the XtMainLoop procedure is called when the initial widgets for the program have been
    realized and are ready for interaction </li>
  <li>once this procedure is called, the application program has lost control and control is
    transferred to X </li>
  <li>XtMainLoop waits for an event to occur and when it does it sends the event to the widget
    that should handle it, this is the interaction part of the program </li>
  <li>the declaration of this procedure is: <pre>
    void XtMainLoop()
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>note that this procedure never returns </li>
</ul>

<h3><font color="#0000FF">5) XtAddCallback </font></h3>

<ul>
  <li>callback procedures are used for communications between widgets and the application,
    whenever something important occurs in a widget callback procedures can be called </li>
  <li>a widget usually has several callback lists, each lists corresponds to a particular
    situation, when this situation occurs all the procedures on the list are called </li>
  <li>the XtAddCallback procedure is used to add a procedure to a callback list, it doesn't
    remove any of the existing procedures on the list </li>
  <li>the declaration of this procedure is: <pre>
    void XtAddCallback(object, callback_name, callback,
	      client_data)
    Widget              object;
    String              callback_name;
    XtCallbackProc callback;
    XtPointer           client_data
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>the first parameter is the widget the callback is being added to, and callback_name is
    the callback list that the callback will be added to </li>
  <li>the callback parameter is the name of the callback procedure </li>
  <li>the client_data parameter is a pointer to a data structure that will be passed to the
    callback procedure when it is called </li>
  <li>a callback procedure is declared in the following way: <pre>

    void callback_proc(w, client_data, call_data)
    Widget              w;
    XtPointer      client_data;
    XtPointer      call_data;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>the first parameter is the widget that the callback was called from, the same callback
    procedure could be used with more than one widget </li>
  <li>the second parameter is the client data that was passed when the callback procedure was
    added to the callback list, this is from the call to XtAddCallback </li>
  <li>since the client_data parameter is a pointer, the callback procedure can modify the data
    structure that it points to </li>
  <li>the same client_data structure can be shared by several callback procedures, it can be
    used to pass information between these procedures, later we will see examples of how this
    is used </li>
  <li>the third parameter is a pointer to a data structure that is provided by the widget, the
    contents of this data structure depend on the widget and the reason for the callback </li>
  <li>for example in the case of a scrollbar, the call_data will contain the new position of
    the thumb, the callback procedure can use this information to move the information that is
    displayed in the corresponding display widget </li>
</ul>

<h2><font color="#FF0000">Example Program</font> </h2>

<ul>
  <li>the first example program puts a button on the screen, when the left mouse button is
    pressed in this button the programs exits </li>
  <li>a Command widget is used for the button, the name of this widget is used as the label
    for the button </li>
  <li>all Xt programs must include the &amp;ltX11/StringDefs.h&gt; and
    &amp;ltX11/Intrinsic.h&gt; include files, in addition an include file for each widget
    class used in the application must also be included </li>
  <li>in this example the Command widget is used so we must also include
    &amp;ltX11/Xaw/Command.h&gt; </li>
  <li>the main program initializes the toolkit, creates the command widget, adds a callback to
    the command widget, realizes the widget hierarchy and then calls XtMainLoop </li>
  <li>the callback procedure simply exits from the program </li>
</ul>

<h2><font color="#FF0000">Setting Resource Values </font></h2>

<ul>
  <li>resources are used to specify all aspects of a widget that can be changed </li>
  <li>the case of the command widget, the widget label, its size, its position, the colour and
    font of the text, etc can all be modified by setting resource values </li>
  <li>there are many ways of setting resource values, we will only look at one of them, this
    technique works for most resource values, and is quite flexible </li>
  <li>a resource consists of a name and a value, the name is represented by a character
    string, and the value is represented by some type that is implementation dependent </li>
  <li>usually the value representation is a 32 bit word, so integers and floats can be stored
    directly in it, and for all other types of values a pointer must be used </li>
  <li>the technique that we will use largely avoids the representation issue </li>
  <li>the following structure is used to represent resources: <pre>
    typedef &quot;something&quot; XtArgVal;

    typedef struct {
	 String    name;
	 XtArgVal  value;
    } Arg, *ArgList;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>&quot;something&quot; is the data structure that the implementation uses to represent
    resources </li>
  <li>the name field is the name of the resource, a character string </li>
  <li>the value field is the value of the resource </li>
  <li>most Xt routines actually take arrays of Arg structures and not single resource
    specifications </li>
  <li>the XtSetArg macro can be used to fill in the entries in this structure </li>
  <li>the XtSetArg macro behaves in the following way: XtSetArg(arg, name, value) Arg arg;
    String name; XtArgVal value; </li>
  <li>arg is an entry in an Arg array, name is the name of the resource, and value is the
    resource value </li>
  <li>for each widget the <b>Quick Reference Guide</b> gives a list of its resources, the type
    of the resource value, and the resource's default value (some of these are wrong) </li>
  <li>the actual string from this table can be used, for example in the case of the label
    resource the string &quot;label&quot; can be used as the resource name, spelling mistakes
    are not errors, the resource is ignored </li>
  <li>a safer way to specify the resource name is to use a set of constants that the widget
    defines in its include file </li>
  <li>there is a standard way to determine these constants, the letters XtN are added to the
    front of the resource name </li>
  <li>for example, for the label resource the constanct XtNlabel can be used as the resource
    name </li>
  <li>when we want to establish the resource values for a widget the following program
    skeleton is used: <pre>
    Arg args[10]
    int n;


    n = 0;
    XtSetArg(args[n],XtNheight,200); n++;
    XtSetArg(args[n],XtNwidth,200); n++;
    XtSetArg(args[n],XtNlabel,&quot;my label&quot;); n++;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>the XtSetValues procedure can be used to add the resource values to the widget, the
    declaration of this procedure is: <pre>
    void XtSetValues(w, args, num_args)
    Widget    w;
    ArgList   args;
    int  num_args;
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>w is the widget the resources are added to, args is the list of resource values, and
    num_args is the number of entries in the list </li>
  <li>for the above example, we can add the resouces using the following procedure call <pre>
    XtSetValues(w, args, n);
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><font color="#FF0000">Example Program </font></h2>

<ul>
  <li>the next example program sets some of the resources in the command widget </li>
  <li>first the size of the widget is changed to be 200 pixel high and 200 pixels wide, this
    is done by setting the height and width resources of the widget </li>
  <li>then the label of the widget is changed to &quot;press and die&quot;, this is done by
    setting the label resource for the widget </li>
  <li>now we can give the widget a reasonable name, like &quot;command&quot; </li>
</ul>

<h2><font color="#FF0000">Creating and Managing Widgets </font></h2>

<ul>
  <li>the XtCreateManagedWidget procedure really performs two tasks, it creates a widget and
    then manages it under its parent </li>
  <li>when a parent only has a few widgets this is the easiest way to create the children, but
    it can lead to inefficiency when a parent has a lot of children, or not all of them should
    be visible at the same time </li>
  <li>when a widget is managed the parent must find some screen space for it, this means that
    the parent itself may need to grow and other widgets may need to move </li>
  <li>if a parent has a lot of children, these operations are repeated each time a new widget
    is created using XtCreateManagedWidget, in this case it would be more efficient to batch
    all the manage requests and do the widget layout once </li>
  <li>managing and creating widgets can be done using the following procedures: <pre>
    Widget XtCreateWidget(name, object_class, parent, args,
	  num_args)
    String         name;
    WidgetClass    object_class;
    Widget         parent;
    ArgList        args;
    int            num_args;

    XtManageChild(child)
    Widget         child;

    XtManageChildren(children,num_children)
    WidgetList     children
    int            num_children
</pre>
  </li>
  <li>the XtCreateWidget procedure creates a new widget without managing it </li>
  <li>the XtManageChild procedure will make the named child managed, which will make it
    visible </li>
  <li>the XtManageChildren procedure takes a list of children, all the widgets on this list
    must have the same parent widget, and manages them, this operation saves time </li>
  <li>the WidgetList type is an array of widgets </li>
  <li>widgets can also be unmanaged, when this occurs the widget disappears from the screen,
    and depending upon the parent its screen space can be reused by other widgets </li>
  <li>managing and unmanaging widgets can be used to control the widgets that are visible on
    the screen, if you don't want a command to be active at a particular point in time you can
    unmanage its widgets </li>
  <li>the widget unmanaging procedure have the following declarations <pre>
    XtUnmanageChild(child)
    Widget         child;

    XtUnmanageChildren(children,num_children)
    WidgetList     children;
    int       num_children;
		 
</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><font color="#FF0000">Example Program </font></h2>

<ul>
  <li>the next example program shows how widgets can be created and managed separately, and
    how the client data can be used in a callback procedure </li>
  <li>this example program creates an arbitrary number of buttons in a box widget </li>
  <li>a char array, called names, contains the names of the buttons and one command widget is
    created for each entry in the array </li>
  <li>a parallel array, called values, contains an integer value for each entry in the names
    array, this value is printed each time the corresponding command widget is selected </li>
  <li>the same callback procedure is used for all of the command widgets, when XtAddCallback
    is called the appropriate entry in the values array is passed as the client data, note
    that a pointer must be used for this </li>
</ul>
