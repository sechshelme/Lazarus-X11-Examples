2 Compiling and Installing
--------------------------

V1.0 of the program is very simple. 

make greasymouse
	creates the greasymouse binary.


I don't have an Imakefile, so if anyone wants to send me one, I would really
appreciate it.

It has been compiled on Linux, Solaris and Irix (several versions of each) with
no problems.



3 What does it do?
------------------

Greasy mouse does just that. It greases your mouse - it makes it slide around 
the screen and bounce off the edges. It was supposed to serve no useful purpose
whatsoever, but unfortunately I came across a computer with a very bad mouse 
that moved very slowly. Increasing the speed setting made it move with very low
resolution, so I ran greasymouse and it worked fine.

Esentially, it calculates the speed of the mouse and keeps moving the mouse at 
that speed. It also divides the speed by a `greasyness' factor each iteration, 
so it usually slows down, unless you set the greasyness to less than unity.



4 Why could I possibly want this?
---------------------------------

Erm... for fun. It's quite amusing to run it on an unsuspecting victim's 
computer and watch them gawp as the mouse starts bouncing around the screen. 
It also makes small buttons *very* hard to click on but makes the mouse very 
smooth to use, and afterwards it seems very jerky.



5 Command line options
----------------------

gm [grease factor]
gm --help

Grease factor is any floating point number thet the speed is divided by each 
iteration.
1.031 	is the default
1 	the mouse just keeps on going
>4	almost no noticable effect
<1 	*CAREFUL* the mouse accfelerates continuously and eventually gets stuck.
	If you have pointer focus on then it can be very difficult to kill if
	you don't have virtual terminals or another computer to rlogin from.



6 Bugs
------

None, really. Except it eventually gets stuck in a corner with negative damping.
But that's not a bug.




7 Todo
------

Ooooh, loads of things:
*	Proper command line options
*	`Focal lines' if you were to have an attractive focal line along the
	bottom of the screen that would be like having gravity affecting the
	mouse.
*	Focal points. Have you ever wondered how a charged mouse would 
	respond in an arcane physics experiment?
*	Bouncing relative to a non root window. This will make paint packages
	much more fun.


8 Ports
-------

Because it's so simple, it should compile on almost C compiler with X11 libs. If
you want it ported to MacOS / BeOS / Windows / RiscOS etc, then make sure you
have a large desk, and grease it!

Although, for this program, you probably won't need to.
